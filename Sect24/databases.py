# SQL VS NoSQL

# SQL Structured Query Language
# mysql
# postgrsql

# SQL Structure
# Tabulated Data
# can be infelxible espcially e.g say one user has a specific field of data and another doesnt this presents a problem 
# since the sysytem saves the missing field for other users as null which can cause significant bugs

# RELATIONSHIPS
# SQL allowws you to create relationships between tables 
# e.g the relationship between the customer list table and the product list table in the order table. you can link a product to the customer who bought it

# have been around for long
table structure
requires a schema


# NoSQL Not only SQL (any format except sql)
# MongoDB
# Redis

# Allows for flexibility
# Data represented in json this allows for flexibilty

# RELATIONAL 
# creating relationships is alot more clumsy but can be done

# SCALABILITY
# easier since the way the data is structured in documents (indicidual rows of data stored in documents) allows you to distribute the db horizonally 

# shiny and new
# document structure
# more flexible
# not great with complex RELATIONSHIPS
# horizontally scalable

# choosing between either structures is dependent on your needs
